#### One-way-binding
One-way data binding will ==bind the data from the component to the view (DOM)== or from view to the component. One-way data binding is unidirectional. You can only bind the data from component to the view or from view to the component.


```
example:

1. public name: string = 'John Cena';

2. <p> Name is: {{name}} </p>

==> RESULT:
Name is: John Cena

```
